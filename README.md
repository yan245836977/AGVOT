## This is formal codes&data for work: "AGVOT: visual object tracking via cooperation of aerial and ground views"

This work proposes a novel benchmark called aerial and ground cooperation dataset of VOT (AGVOT). AGVOT consists of 643 sequences of aerial and ground views with 119859 image pairs (1080p/30fps and 720p/60fps). These image pairs are collected from 15 scenes and cover 26 categories of objects. All codes and data will be released when our work is accepted formally.

### Partial Cases of AGVOT
Due to the large size of the original AGVOT dataset, we have prepared part of the AGVOT data (both 1080p and 4k versions) in the following link to make it easier for readers to intuitively understand the directory structure of the dataset, the annotation format, and test their own code. You can down these partrial cases from this [link (Baidu Netdisk)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gWPjd_5FGqAqT1g9lX4zIA) (code: ).
