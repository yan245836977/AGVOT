## This is formal codes&data for work: "AGVOT: visual object tracking via cooperation of aerial and ground views"

This work proposes a novel benchmark called aerial and ground cooperation dataset of VOT (AGVOT). AGVOT consists of 643 sequences of aerial and ground views with 119859 image pairs (1080p/30fps and 720p/60fps). These image pairs are collected from 15 scenes and cover 26 categories of objects. All codes and data will be released when our work is accepted formally.
